1 - There is a strange pause and intonation when it says  “Home and Away”, I tried to fix it, but it didn’t get perfect.
2 - Angelina “Jolie” is mispronounced, the “j” does not sound like [ʤ], but [Ʒ]. 
3- Second (II) is read as two. 
4- BAFTA it i read as it's written and it’s not mentioned the name of the award (British Academy Film Awards).
5 - The spanish words on Shakira’s text are also mispronounced, but even adding it to the new lexicon did not give a good improvement to the pronunciation .
